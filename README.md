# executor-profile

Three different plugins (for now)
Shortcode1: [display_all_user_profiles] (displays all the profiles)
Shortcode2: [display_selected_user_profile]. Page where you can view a certain profiles info (not your own). Accessible (works) for now 
only by clicking "view profile" on the "all user"- page.
Shortcode3: [display_user_info]: Page where you can view and edit your own profile.


At the moment you also need the plugin "Simple Local Avatars" - so that changing the profile pictures -functionality works.
